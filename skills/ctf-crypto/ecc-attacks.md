## Braid Group DH — Alexander Polynomial Multiplicativity (DiceCTF 2026)

**Pattern (Plane or Exchange):** Diffie-Hellman key exchange built over mathematical braids. Public keys are derived by connecting a private braid to public info, then scrambled with Reidemeister-like moves. Shared secret = `sha256(normalize(calculate(connect(my_priv, their_pub))))`. The `calculate()` function computes the Alexander polynomial of the braid.

**Protocol structure:**
```python
import sympy as sp
import hashlib

t = sp.Symbol('t')

def compose(p1, p2):
    return [p1[p2[i]] for i in range(len(p1))]

def inverse(p):
    inv = [0] * len(p)
    for i, j in enumerate(p):
        inv[j] = i
    return inv

def connect(g1, g2):
    """Concatenate two braids with a swap at the junction."""
    x1, o1 = g1
    x2, o2 = g2
    l = len(x1)
    new_x = list(x1) + [v + l for v in x2]
    new_o = list(o1) + [v + l for v in o2]
    # Swap at junction
    new_x[l-1], new_x[l] = new_x[l], new_x[l-1]
    return (new_x, new_o)

def sweep(ap):
    """Compute winding number matrix from arc presentation."""
    l = len(ap)
    current_row = [0] * l
    matrix = []
    for pair in ap:
        c1, c2 = sorted(pair)
        diff = pair[1] - pair[0]
        s = 1 if diff > 0 else (-1 if diff < 0 else 0)
        for c in range(c1, c2):
            current_row[c] += s
        matrix.append(list(current_row))
    return matrix

def mine(point):
    x, o = point
    return sweep([*zip(x, o)])

def calculate(point):
    """Compute Alexander polynomial from braid."""
    mat = sp.Matrix([[t**(-x) for x in y] for y in mine(point)])
    return mat.det(method='bareiss') * (1 - t)**(1 - len(point[0]))

def normalize(calculation):
    """Convert Laurent polynomial to standard form."""
    poly = sp.expand(sp.simplify(calculation))
    all_exp = [term.as_coeff_exponent(t)[1] for term in poly.as_ordered_terms()]
    min_exp = min(all_exp)
    poly = sp.expand(sp.simplify(poly * t**(-min_exp)))
    if poly.coeff(t, 0) < 0:
        poly *= -1
    return poly

# Key exchange:
# alice_pub = scramble(connect(pub_info, alice_priv), 1000)
# bob_pub = scramble(connect(pub_info, bob_priv), 1000)
# shared = sha256(str(normalize(calculate(connect(alice_priv, bob_pub)))))
```

**The fatal vulnerability — Alexander polynomial multiplicativity:**

The Alexander polynomial satisfies `Δ(β₁·β₂) = Δ(β₁) × Δ(β₂)` under braid concatenation. This makes the scheme abelian:

```python
# Eve computes shared secret from public values only:
calc_pub = normalize(calculate(pub_info))
calc_alice = normalize(calculate(alice_pub))
calc_bob = normalize(calculate(bob_pub))

# Recover Alice's private polynomial
calc_alice_priv = sp.cancel(calc_alice / calc_pub)  # exact division

# Shared secret = calc(alice_priv) * calc(bob_pub) = calc(bob_priv) * calc(alice_pub)
shared_poly = normalize(sp.expand(calc_alice_priv * calc_bob))
shared_hex = hashlib.sha256(str(shared_poly).encode()).hexdigest()

# Decrypt XOR stream cipher
key = bytes.fromhex(shared_hex)
while len(key) < len(ciphertext):
    key += hashlib.sha256(key).digest()
plaintext = bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(ciphertext, key))
```

**Computational trick for large matrices:**

Direct sympy Bareiss on rational-function matrices (e.g., 30×30 with entries `t^(-w)`) is extremely slow. Clear denominators first:

```python
# Winding numbers range from w_min to w_max (e.g., -1 to 5)
# Multiply all entries by t^w_max to get polynomial matrix
k = max(abs(w) for row in winding_matrix for w in row)
n = len(winding_matrix)

# Original: M[i][j] = t^(-w[i][j])
# Scaled:   M'[i][j] = t^(k - w[i][j])  (all non-negative powers)
mat_poly = sp.Matrix([[t**(k - w) for w in row] for row in winding_matrix])
det_scaled = mat_poly.det(method='bareiss')  # Much faster!

# Recover true determinant: det(M) = det(M') / t^(k*n)
det_true = sp.cancel(det_scaled / t**(k * n))
# Then: (1-t)^(n-1) divides det_true (topological property)
result = sp.cancel(det_true * (1 - t)**(1 - n))
```

**Validation — palindromic property:**
All valid Alexander polynomials are palindromic (coefficients read the same forwards and backwards). Use this as a sanity check on intermediate results:
```python
def is_palindromic(poly, var=t):
    coeffs = sp.Poly(poly, var).all_coeffs()
    return coeffs == coeffs[::-1]
```

**When to recognize:** Challenge mentions braids, knots, permutation pairs, winding numbers, Reidemeister moves, or "topological key exchange." The key mathematical insight is that the Alexander polynomial — while a powerful knot/braid invariant — is multiplicative, making it fundamentally unsuitable as a one-way function for Diffie-Hellman.

**Key lessons:**
- **Diffie-Hellman requires non-abelian hardness.** If the invariant used for the shared secret is multiplicative/commutative under the group operation, Eve can compute it from public values.
- **Scrambling (Reidemeister moves) doesn't help** — the Alexander polynomial is an invariant, so scrambled braids produce the same polynomial.
- **Large symbolic determinants** need the denominator-clearing trick: multiply by `t^k` to get polynomials, compute det, divide back.

## Monotone Function Inversion with Partial Output

**Pattern:** A flag is converted to a real number, pushed through an invertible/monotone function (e.g., iterated map, spiral), then some output digits are masked/erased. Recover the masked digits to invert and get the flag.

**Identification:**
- Output is a high-precision decimal number with some digits replaced by `?`
- The transformation is smooth/monotone (invertible via root-finding)
- Flag format constrains the input to a narrow range
- Challenge hints like "brute won't cut it" or "binary search"

**Key insight:** For a monotone function `f`, knowing the flag format (e.g., `0xL4ugh{...}`) constrains the output to a tiny interval. Many "unknown" output digits are actually **fixed** across all valid inputs and can be determined immediately.

**Attack: Hierarchical Digit Recovery**

1. **Determine fixed digits:** Compute `f(flag_min)` and `f(flag_max)` for all valid flags. Digits that are identical in both outputs are fixed regardless of flag content.

2. **Sequential refinement:** Determine remaining unknown digits one at a time (largest contribution first). For each candidate value (0-9), invert `f` and check if the result is a valid flag (ASCII, correct format).

3. **Validation:** The correct digit produces readable ASCII text; wrong digits produce garbage bytes in the flag.

```python
import mpmath

# Match SageMath's RealField(N) precision exactly:
# RealField(256) = 256-bit MPFR mantissa
mpmath.mp.prec = 256  # BINARY precision (not decimal!)
# For decimal: mpmath.mp.dps = N sets decimal places

phi = (mpmath.mpf(1) + mpmath.sqrt(mpmath.mpf(5))) / 2

def forward(x0):
    """The challenge's transformation (e.g., iterated spiral)."""
    x = x0
    for i in range(iterations):
        r = mpmath.mpf(i) / mpmath.mpf(iterations)
        x = r * mpmath.sqrt(x*x + 1) + (1 - r) * (x + phi)
    return x

def invert(y_target, x_guess):
    """Invert via root-finding (Newton's method)."""
    def f(x0):
        return forward(x0) - y_target
    return mpmath.findroot(f, x_guess, tol=mpmath.mpf(10)**(-200))

# Hierarchical search: determine unknown digits sequentially
masked = "?7086013?3756162?51694057..."
unknown_positions = [0, 8, 16, 25, 33, ...]

# Step 1: Fix digits that are constant across all valid flags
# (compute forward for min/max valid flag, compare)

# Step 2: For each remaining unknown (largest positional weight first):
for pos in remaining_unknowns:
    for digit in range(10):
        # Set this digit, others to middle value (5)
        output_val = construct_number(known_digits | {pos: digit})
        x_inv = invert(output_val, x_guess=0.335)
        flag_int = int(x_inv * mpmath.power(10, flag_digits))
        flag_bytes = flag_int.to_bytes(30, 'big')

        # Check: starts with prefix? Ends with suffix? All ASCII?
        if is_valid_flag(flag_bytes):
            known_digits[pos] = digit
            break
```

**Why it works:** Each unknown digit affects a different decimal scale in the output number. The largest unknown (earliest position) shifts the inverted value by the most, determining several bytes of the flag. Fixing it and moving to the next unknown reveals more bytes. Total work: `10 * num_unknowns` inversions (linear, not exponential).

**Precision matching:** SageMath's `RealField(N)` uses MPFR with N-bit mantissa. In mpmath, set `mp.prec = N` (NOT `mp.dps`). The last few output digits are precision-sensitive and will only match with the correct binary precision.

**Derivative analysis:** For the spiral-type map `x → r*sqrt(x²+1) + (1-r)*(x+φ)`, the per-step derivative is `r*x/sqrt(x²+1) + (1-r) ≈ 1`, so the total derivative stays near 1 across all 81 iterations. This means precision is preserved through inversion — 67 known output digits give ~67 digits of input precision.

## Tropical Semiring Residuation Attack (BearCatCTF 2026)

**Pattern (Tropped):** Diffie-Hellman key exchange using tropical matrices (min-plus algebra). Per-character shared secret XOR'd with encrypted flag.

**Tropical algebra:**
- Addition = `min(a, b)`
- Multiplication = `a + b`
- Matrix multiply: `(A*B)[i,j] = min_k(A[i,k] + B[k,j])`

**Tropical residuation recovers shared secret from public data:**
```python
def tropical_residuate(M, Mb, aM, n):
    """Recover shared secret from public matrices.
    M = public matrix, Mb = M*b (Bob's public), aM = a*M (Alice's public)
    """
    # Right residual: b*[j] = max_i(Mb[i] - M[i][j])
    b_star = [max(Mb[i] - M[i][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(n)]
    # Shared secret: aMb = min_j(aM[j] + b*[j])
    aMb = min(aM[j] + b_star[j] for j in range(n))
    return aMb

# Decrypt per-character: key = aMb % 32; plaintext = key ^ ciphertext
for i, enc_char in enumerate(encrypted):
    key = shared_secret % 32
    plaintext_char = chr(key ^ ord(enc_char))
```

**Key insight:** Tropical DH is broken because the min-plus semiring lacks cancellation — given `M` and `M*b`, the "residual" `b*` can be computed directly via `max(Mb[i] - M[i][j])`. Unlike standard DH where recovering `b` from `g^b` is hard, tropical residuation recovers enough of `b`'s effect to compute the shared secret. This makes tropical matrix DH insecure for any matrix size.

**Detection:** Challenge mentions "tropical", "min-plus", "exotic algebra", or defines custom matrix multiplication using `min` and `+`.

## Small Subgroup Attacks

- Check curve order for small factors
- Pohlig-Hellman: solve DLP in small subgroups, combine with CRT

```python
# SageMath ECC basics
E = EllipticCurve(GF(p), [a, b])
G = E.gens()[0]  # generator
order = E.order()
```

---

## Invalid Curve Attacks

If point validation is missing, send points on weaker curves. Craft points with small-order subgroups to leak secret key bits.

---

## Singular Curves

If discriminant delta = 0, curve is singular. DLP becomes easy (maps to additive/multiplicative group).

---

## Smart's Attack (Anomalous Curves)

**When to use:** Curve order equals field characteristic p (anomalous curve). Solves ECDLP in O(1) via p-adic lifting.

**Detection:** `E.order() == p` — always check this first!

**SageMath (automatic):**
```python
E = EllipticCurve(GF(p), [a, b])
G = E(Gx, Gy)
Q = E(Qx, Qy)
# Sage's discrete_log handles anomalous curves automatically
secret = G.discrete_log(Q)
```

**Manual p-adic lift (when Sage's auto method fails):**
```python
def smart_attack(p, a, b, G, Q):
    E = EllipticCurve(GF(p), [a, b])
    Qp = pAdicField(p, 2)  # p-adic field with precision 2
    Ep = EllipticCurve(Qp, [a, b])

    # Lift points to p-adics
    Gp = Ep.lift_x(ZZ(G[0]), all=True)  # try both lifts
    Qp_point = Ep.lift_x(ZZ(Q[0]), all=True)

    for gp in Gp:
        for qp in Qp_point:
            try:
                # Multiply by p to get points in kernel of reduction
                pG = p * gp
                pQ = p * qp
                # Extract p-adic logarithm
                x_G = ZZ(pG[0] / pG[1]) / p  # or pG.xy()
                x_Q = ZZ(pQ[0] / pQ[1]) / p
                secret = ZZ(x_Q / x_G) % p
                if E(G) * secret == E(Q):
                    return secret
            except (ZeroDivisionError, ValueError):
                continue
    return None
```

**Multi-layer decryption after key recovery:** Challenge may wrap flag in AES-CBC + DES-CBC or similar — just busywork once the ECC key is recovered. Derive keys with SHA-256 of shared secret.

---

## ECC Fault Injection

**Pattern (Faulty Curves):** Bit flip during ECC computation reveals private key bits.

**Attack:** Compare correct vs faulty ciphertext, recover key bit-by-bit:
```python
# For each key bit position:
# If fault at bit i changes output -> key bit i affects computation
# Binary distinguisher: faulty_output == correct_output -> bit is 0
```

---

## Clock Group DLP via Pohlig-Hellman (LACTF 2026)

**Pattern (the-clock):** Diffie-Hellman on unit circle group: x^2 + y^2 = 1 (mod p).

**Key facts:**
- Group law: (x1,y1) * (x2,y2) = (x1*y2 + y1*x2, y1*y2 - x1*x2)
- **Group order = p + 1** (not p - 1!)
- Isomorphic to GF(p^2)* elements of norm 1

**Group operations:**
```python
def clock_mul(P, Q, p):
    x1, y1 = P
    x2, y2 = Q
    return ((x1*y2 + y1*x2) % p, (y1*y2 - x1*x2) % p)

def clock_pow(P, n, p):
    result = (0, 1)  # identity
    base = P
    while n > 0:
        if n & 1:
            result = clock_mul(result, base, p)
        base = clock_mul(base, base, p)
        n >>= 1
    return result
```

**Recovering hidden prime p:**
```python
# Given points on the curve, p divides (x^2 + y^2 - 1)
from math import gcd
vals = [x**2 + y**2 - 1 for x, y in known_points]
p = reduce(gcd, vals)
# May need to remove small factors
```

**Attack when p+1 is smooth:**
```python
# 1. Recover p from points: gcd(x^2 + y^2 - 1) across known points
# 2. Factor p+1 into small primes
# 3. Pohlig-Hellman: solve DLP in each small subgroup, CRT combine
# 4. Compute shared secret, derive AES key (e.g., via MD5)
```

**Identification:** Challenge mentions "clock", "circle", or gives points satisfying x^2+y^2=1. Always check if p+1 (not p-1) is smooth.

---

## Ed25519 Torsion Side Channel (BearCatCTF 2026)

**Pattern (Curvy Wurvy):** Ed25519 signing oracle derives per-user keys as `user_key = MASTER_KEY * uid mod l` (where `l` is the Ed25519 subgroup order). Goal: recover `MASTER_KEY` from oracle queries.

**The attack exploits Ed25519's cofactor h=8:**
- Full curve order = `8*l`, but scalars are reduced mod `l`
- When `MASTER_KEY * 2^t` wraps around `l`, multiplication produces a torsion component visible as y-coordinate change

**Key extraction via binary decomposition:**
```python
# Query sign(uid=3, 2^t) for t = 0..255
# S_t = (MASTER_KEY * 2^t mod l) * P3
# Check: does doubling S_t match S_{t+1}?

bits = []
for t in range(255):
    S_t = query_sign(3, 2**t)
    S_t1 = query_sign(3, 2**(t+1))
    doubled = point_double(S_t)
    # Wrap occurred if doubled.y != S_{t+1}.y (torsion shift)
    bits.append(0 if doubled.y == S_t1.y else 1)

# Reconstruct: MASTER_KEY ≈ l * (0.bit0 bit1 bit2 ...)_binary
# Try all 8 torsion corrections for exact value
```

**Key insight:** Ed25519's cofactor creates an observable side channel: when scalar multiplication wraps around the subgroup order `l`, the result shifts by a torsion element (one of 8 points). By querying powers of 2 and checking y-coordinate consistency, each bit of the secret scalar is leaked. Libraries like `ecpy` that reduce mod `l` are vulnerable to this when used in multi-user key derivation schemes.

**Detection:** Ed25519 signing oracle with user-controlled UID or multiplier. Key derivation formula `key = master * uid mod l`.

---

## ECDSA Nonce Reuse (BearCatCTF 2026)

**Pattern (Chatroom):** ECDSA signatures on secp256k1 with constant nonce `k`. When two signatures share the same `r` value, the nonce and private key are recoverable.

**Recovery:**
```python
from hashlib import sha256

# Two signatures (r, s1) and (r, s2) with same r → same nonce k
h1 = int(sha256(msg1).hexdigest(), 16)
h2 = int(sha256(msg2).hexdigest(), 16)
n = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEBAAEDCE6AF48A03BBFD25E8CD0364141  # secp256k1 order

k = ((h1 - h2) * pow(s1 - s2, -1, n)) % n
d = ((s1 * k - h1) * pow(r, -1, n)) % n  # private key
```

**Key insight:** Same `r` value across multiple ECDSA signatures means the nonce `k` was reused. This is the same class of bug that compromised the PlayStation 3 signing key. Always check for repeated `r` values in signature datasets.

**Detection:** Multiple ECDSA signatures with identical `r` component. Challenge mentions "nonce", "deterministic signing", or provides a signing oracle.

**Key facts:**
- Group law: (x1,y1) * (x2,y2) = (x1*y2 + y1*x2, y1*y2 - x1*x2)
- **Group order = p + 1** (not p - 1!)

    return result
```

vals = [x**2 + y**2 - 1 for x, y in known_points]
p = reduce(gcd, vals)
# May need to remove small factors
```

**Attack when p+1 is smooth:**
```python
# 1. Recover p from points: gcd(x^2 + y^2 - 1) across known points
# 2. Factor p+1 into small primes
# 3. Pohlig-Hellman: solve DLP in each small subgroup, CRT combine
# 4. Compute shared secret, derive AES key (e.g., via MD5)
```

**Identification:** Challenge mentions "clock", "circle", or gives points satisfying x^2+y^2=1. Always check if p+1 (not p-1) is smooth.

## Ed25519 Torsion Side Channel (BearCatCTF 2026)

**Pattern (Curvy Wurvy):** Ed25519 signing oracle derives per-user keys as `user_key = MASTER_KEY * uid mod l` (where `l` is the Ed25519 subgroup order). Goal: recover `MASTER_KEY` from oracle queries.

**The attack exploits Ed25519's cofactor h=8:**
- Full curve order = `8*l`, but scalars are reduced mod `l`
- When `MASTER_KEY * 2^t` wraps around `l`, multiplication produces a torsion component visible as y-coordinate change

**Key extraction via binary decomposition:**
```python
# Query sign(uid=3, 2^t) for t = 0..255
# S_t = (MASTER_KEY * 2^t mod l) * P3
# Check: does doubling S_t match S_{t+1}?

bits = []
for t in range(255):
    S_t = query_sign(3, 2**t)
    S_t1 = query_sign(3, 2**(t+1))
    doubled = point_double(S_t)
    # Wrap occurred if doubled.y != S_{t+1}.y (torsion shift)
    bits.append(0 if doubled.y == S_t1.y else 1)

# Reconstruct: MASTER_KEY ≈ l * (0.bit0 bit1 bit2 ...)_binary
# Try all 8 torsion corrections for exact value
```

**Key insight:** Ed25519's cofactor creates an observable side channel: when scalar multiplication wraps around the subgroup order `l`, the result shifts by a torsion element (one of 8 points). By querying powers of 2 and checking y-coordinate consistency, each bit of the secret scalar is leaked. Libraries like `ecpy` that reduce mod `l` are vulnerable to this when used in multi-user key derivation schemes.

**Detection:** Ed25519 signing oracle with user-controlled UID or multiplier. Key derivation formula `key = master * uid mod l`.

## ECDSA Nonce Reuse (BearCatCTF 2026)

**Pattern (Chatroom):** ECDSA signatures on secp256k1 with constant nonce `k`. When two signatures share the same `r` value, the nonce and private key are recoverable.

**Recovery:**
```python
from hashlib import sha256

# Two signatures (r, s1) and (r, s2) with same r → same nonce k
h1 = int(sha256(msg1).hexdigest(), 16)
h2 = int(sha256(msg2).hexdigest(), 16)
n = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEBAAEDCE6AF48A03BBFD25E8CD0364141  # secp256k1 order

k = ((h1 - h2) * pow(s1 - s2, -1, n)) % n
d = ((s1 * k - h1) * pow(r, -1, n)) % n  # private key
```

**Key insight:** Same `r` value across multiple ECDSA signatures means the nonce `k` was reused. This is the same class of bug that compromised the PlayStation 3 signing key. Always check for repeated `r` values in signature datasets.

**Detection:** Multiple ECDSA signatures with identical `r` component. Challenge mentions "nonce", "deterministic signing", or provides a signing oracle.
